**Gifting NFT**
- What if we an gift your special one an NFT on Christmas, or your lover on anniversary?
- What if NFTs are the new gift card in the future, and on that special day you send someone a NFTs. 
- These NFTs can be an art, a gen. membership card, or anything ERC721 token

Problem: The concept of NFTs should be more for leisure use and not for buy/sell to make more money. At some point, people will buy NFTs to gift to their friends and families.

Solution: Create a contract that allow user to select their NFTs and be able to choose a specify date to send that NFT as a gift to another address.

Workflow: 
1) User accept address to view for website to view NFTs
2) Select the NFT they want to gift
3) User select a date they want the contract to send this gift
4) The NFT goes into the contract
5) On the specify date, the contract will send a message or a "YOU HAVE A GIFT" nft to the user?
6) User then use CLAIM to claim their gift.
